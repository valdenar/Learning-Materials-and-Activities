<h1>Learning Materials and Activities</h1>
Through providing a set of learning materials, Plazi (https://plazi.org/)  intends to enable users to release data, inspire the development of enhanced new tools, and build a collaborative community. The Plazi-community is organized on Github and is open for contribution. Plazi offers a set of certificate granting online open modular courses, as well as workshops and training courses online and presential to scientific community around the world. 
<h2>Learning Modules</h2>
Learning material includes presentations of Plazi’s goals and workflow, as well as concepts that are the base of data liberation process. Tools to annotate publications and work on data extraction are presented along with guides, tutorials, and screencasts. The use of platforms for queries and data reuse is introduced through explanations and tutorials.
<h2>Certificates</h2>
The courses provide certification after the module’s assignments conclusion. After the completion of the modules “Individual Extraction” and “Quality Control” (hyperlinks to the modules) the participant can obtain login and password to extract and liberate data using GGI and Plazi's platforms as new certificates. The data liberations are approved by the Plazi team, and the new certificates receive feedback concerning data quality by email until fully qualified.
<h2>Audience</h2>
Scientific community, citizen scientists
