<h1>Learning Materials and Activities</h1>
Through providing a set of learning materials, Plazi (https://plazi.org/)  intends to enable users to release data, inspire the development of enhanced new tools, and build a collaborative community. The Plazi-community is organized on Github and is open for contribution. Plazi offers a set of certificate granting online open modular courses, as well as workshops and training courses online and presential to scientific community around the world. 
<h2>Learning Modules</h2>
Learning material includes presentations of Plazi’s goals and workflow, as well as concepts that are the base of data liberation process. Tools to annotate publications and work on data extraction are presented along with guides, tutorials, and screencasts. The use of platforms for queries and data reuse is introduced through explanations and tutorials.
<h2>Certificates</h2>
The courses provide certification after the module’s assignments conclusion. After the completion of the modules “Individual Extraction” and “Quality Control” (hyperlinks to the modules) the participant can obtain login and password to extract and liberate data using GGI and Plazi's platforms as new certificates. The data liberations are approved by the Plazi team, and the new certificates receive feedback concerning data quality by email until fully qualified.
<h2>Audience</h2>
Scientific community, citizen scientists

<h2>Module – Plazi Presentation</h2>

**Description**: In this module we briefly present where we come from and where we can go, Plazi's workflow and main taxonomic repositories.
 
**Prerequisites**: none.

**Learning objective**: 

* Introduction to course and members
* Biodiversity informatics and FAIR data
* Taxonomic literature and the ‘Plazi way’

Join module with Google Classroom (https://classroom.google.com/), using the class code **bqzqmzk**.

<h2>Module – Individual Extraction</h2>

**Description**: In this module you will get to know the computer program used to extract data for scholarly publications: the GoldenGate Imagine - GGI. You will also get used to the concepts used in the Plazi workflow and concepts that must be understood in order to use the GGI data extraction program. Moreover, you will experience a complete data extraction from a published paper.

**Prerequisites**: none.

**Learning objective**: 

* Taxonomic concepts in data extraction from publications
* GGI and introduction to individual extraction
* Individual extraction

Join module with Google Classroom (https://classroom.google.com/), using the class code **aafo2py**.

<h2>Module – Quality Control</h2>

**Description**: In this module you will get to finish the process of data liberation after an individual or automatic extraction of data from scholarly publications according to Plazi's workflow. This is an important and mandatory step of data liberation. The quality control process detect and correct the extraction errors preventing wrong information to reach the repositories


**Prerequisites**: module “Individual Extraction” (hyperlinks to the modules) certification.

**Learning objective**: 

* Enhancing annotation
* Quality control of data extracted from publications. 

Join module with Google Classroom (https://classroom.google.com/), using the class code **vj6tqd5**.

<h2>Module – Queries and Reuse</h2>

**Description**: In this module you will get to know the different data repositories and experience the use of Plazi's Treatment Bank for queries and searches.

**Prerequisites**: none.

**Learning objective**: 

* Data repositories - Queries and reuse

Join module with Google Classroom (https://classroom.google.com/), using the class code **xqzqsgn**.

<h2>Module – Matching Service</h2>

**Description**: The Matching Service is designed for users to participate of the liberation of scholarly knowledge about biodiversity, allowing them to match the material citations contained in the academic literature to the respective specimens in natural history collections. 

**Prerequisites**: none.

**Learning objective**: 

* Introduction to the Matching Service 
* Accessing the Matching Service
* Matching decisions
